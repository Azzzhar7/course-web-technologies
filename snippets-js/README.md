# JavaScript Practice Tasks for Web Development

This directory contains a series of JavaScript practice tasks to enhance your web development skills. Each task focuses on adding interactivity and improving the user experience on a portfolio page created with Bootstrap. These tasks are beginner-friendly and designed to give practical insights into working with JavaScript in a real-world scenario.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, you will:
- Understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM to manipulate content and styles.
- Improve your JavaScript skills by implementing interactive features.
- Enhance the usability and functionality of a static web page using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript.

## **JavaScript Practice Tasks**

### 2. **Form Validation**
   - Add JavaScript to validate form inputs, ensuring required fields are filled, the email format is correct, and numbers (e.g., phone numbers) are valid.
   - Provide real-time error messages to guide the user.

### 3. **Interactive Image Modal**
   - Enable users to click on portfolio images to view them in a larger size within a modal.
   - Use Bootstrapâ€™s modal component and trigger it via JavaScript when an image is clicked.

### 4. **Toggle Dark Mode**

   - Use JavaScript to show or hide images dynamically based on the category selected.

### 8. **Dynamic Countdown Timer**
   - Add a countdown timer for upcoming events, project deadlines, or portfolio highlights.
